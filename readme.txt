This project investigated the different types of random number generation, including different distributions, different methods of generation, and different methods of gathering a seed.

All notebook files can be found within the EE315 Assignment folder and these include:

-Demo Book: This is the main demo notebook that details all the key points of the assignment

-Sensor-Set-Up: This details the methods used to evaluate each sensor used for seed generation

-Software RNG: This contains investigation into the software methods used to generate uniform, Gaussian and Pareto random numbers

-SpeedTest: This contains a comparison between the hardware and software methods used to generate random numbers

-Uniform_32Bit: This details the hardware random number generation setup, including how it was implemented and tested.
